# Arduino-Delta-Robot
All CAD and code as seen in my YouTube video

All CAD was drawn in Autodesk Inventor But in the STEP Files the assembly is also saved as .stp

The code isn't as developed as I wanted it to be but the project had to be completed in a month

Feel free to incorporate some of these resorces into your own delta robot build!
